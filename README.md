This is the website for a landscaping company. The site is a straight forward site featuring html and css code. 
All the code passes testing apart from the fact when the site is launched, the background image is not showing. 
I worked through several processes to work it out and correct it, but by the launch time I wasn't able to adjust it.
The background image is veiwable in the github launcher however.

## Features

The site features 3 pages inline with user exerience. The site has pages which open in a new tab at the appropriate times.

## Responsive Design

The site is completely mobile first design and looks well on mobile screens aswell as when viewed on larger screen like a desktop.

Here we can see exactly how this is working with the form feature. The element is responsive and fits correctly on both screen types.

## Testing

The css testing passes with no issues. The html passes also, here is a screen grab for the homepage, but the other pages also passed fine.

## Bugs

I did have some bugs at first but they were easily fixable.

Unfortuantely the background image not showing is quite a bigger issue.
